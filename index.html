        	<h1>Hi! Welcome to my portfolio</h1>
        	<h2>About me:</h2>
       	 	<p class="about">I am currently a student at Thomas Edison High School and I'm taking the course Web Design. I plan on majoring in Psyschology when I go to college. As of right now I am really interested in Cosmetology and I host zoom meetings on my free time to teach others on how to do makeup. </p>

        <h4 class="project-header">Character Quiz</h4>
        <p class="about-project">In this project I used else-if conditions and depending on which values were inputed you would get a different result based on what you have entered. The project also displays how many times you have taken the quiz. The most difficult part about this project was coming up with different combinations.</p>
        <h4 class="project-header">Photo Gallery</h4>
        <p class="about-project">In this project I used the append method to get the pictures to show on the page and also get the new image to show when the image address is inputed in the input box. I also used the input.val to make sure the values are stored. </p>
        <h4 class="project-header">Random Quote Generator</h4>
        <p class="about-project">In this project I was able to have my site generate 7 random quotes. I used the .click function to make sure the button was working and operating and also the math.random to make sure it would generate random quotes. </p>
